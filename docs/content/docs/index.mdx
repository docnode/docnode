## What is DocNode

DocNode is a local-first framework. It is primarily composed of:

1. **DocNode Core**: a highly performant type-safe document manager with atomic transactions and an undo manager.
   It supports Operational Transformation (OT) and in the future also a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) mode.
2. **DocNode Sync**: A client-server framework for managing DocNode documents. It synchronizes documents across different
   tabs and clients in real time, both locally and in a central database. It supports authentication,
   conflict resolution, multiplexing, history version, and more.

## How does it compare to Yjs?

## Why another CRDT / OT library?

- **Operational Transformation (OT)**: DocNode is the only actively maintained OT framework. Since it relies on a server, documents avoid soft-deletes and tombstones like CRDTs, keeping them compact. A CRDT mode is planned for scenarios requiring P2P collaboration.
- **Type-safety**: TypeScript is a first-class citizen. You define the shape of your nodes, and DocNode ensures correct parsing and validation.
- **Performance**: DocNode is incredibly fast. Updates are batched automatically, there's no double-buffering/virtual DOM, the event system is designed for fine-grained updates, and serialization is extremely small.
- **Simplicity**: You don't need to worry about which data type to use, since there's only one (DocNode). This makes modeling your document a near-obvious task.
- **API Design**: The API has gone through two years of iteration and refinement. Get ready for many aha moments.
- **Composability**: DocNode is designed from the ground up to support independent extensions and customizations of documents, nodes, and features without conflicts.
- **Schema enforcement**: Do you want your document to always start with a heading? Or never have more than five bullets in a row? DocNode lets you define your own Normalizers to enforce any structure you can imagine.

  {/* - Batteries included? (backend, editor bindings, auth, history version, multiplexing, encryption, etc.)? */}

## About Me

Hi, I'm [German Jablonski](https://x.com/GermanJablo), an Argentinian currently based in the UK and working on Payload development at Figma.

I began working on DocNode in January 2024, but my fascination with CRDTs and OT started back in 2021, when I was building my note editor [Fluski](https://fluski.com).

In Fluski, not only the text editor but also other data structures, like the document tree, are CRDTs. Along the way, I faced countless challenges. That experience pushed me to dive deep into the world of rich-text editors and collaborative data structures. I set up alerts on Google Scholar, Hacker News, and Reddit, and spent years reading every paper and implementation I could find.

Had I known how much time and effort it would take to build DocNode, I probably wouldn’t have been foolish enough to start it. But looking back, I’m glad I did. The world might have missed out on something truly beautiful. What kept me going was the conviction that there had to be a simpler way to work with conflict resolution in documents. That way is now real, and I hope it helps you too.
